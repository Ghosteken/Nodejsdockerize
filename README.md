Docker is a platform designed to make it easier to develop, deploy, and run applications by using containers. Containers allow a developer to package up an application with all parts it needs, such as libraries and other dependencies, and ship it all out as one package.

Here's a brief overview of Docker concepts and how you can use it:

Images: An image is a lightweight, standalone, and executable package that includes everything needed to run a piece of software, including the code, a runtime, libraries, environment variables, and config files.

Containers: Containers are instances of Docker images. They run applications in isolated environments on a host system. Each container shares the host OS kernel but has its own process space, file system, and network.

Dockerfile: A Dockerfile is a script that contains instructions for building a Docker image. It defines the base image, sets up the environment, copies application code, and specifies runtime commands.

Docker Compose: Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. It uses a YAML file to configure the application's services, networks, and volumes.

Basic Docker Commands:
Build an Image:

bash
Copy code
docker build -t image-name:tag .
Run a Container:

bash
Copy code
docker run -p host-port:container-port image-name:tag
List Running Containers:

bash
Copy code
docker ps
List All Containers (including stopped ones):

bash
Copy code
docker ps -a
Stop a Running Container:

bash
Copy code
docker stop container-id
Remove a Container:

bash
Copy code
docker rm container-id
Remove an Image:

bash
Copy code
docker rmi image-id
Docker Compose Commands:

bash
Copy code
docker-compose up
docker-compose down
Example Dockerfile:
Dockerfile
Copy code
# Use an official Node.js runtime as a parent image
FROM node:14

# Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /usr/src/app

# Copy package.json and package-lock.json to the working directory
COPY package*.json ./

# Install app dependencies
RUN npm install

# Copy the application code
COPY . .

# Expose the port on which the app will run
EXPOSE 3000

# Define the command to run your application
CMD ["npm", "start"]
Example Docker Compose file (docker-compose.yml):
yaml
Copy code
version: '3'
services:
  web:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
